Normalization and 3NF Evaluation:

1. First Normal Form (1NF):
1NF requires that the table only contains atomic (indivisible) values and each record (row) is unique.

All the tables in this schema adhere to 1NF as they do not have any multi-valued attributes. Each field holds a single value, and all rows are uniquely identifiable by primary keys.

2. Second Normal Form (2NF):

2NF requires that the table is in 1NF, and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

All the tables also adhere to 2NF because non-key attributes depend entirely on the primary key and not on any partial key.

For example, in the cart table, user_id and course_id are needed to determine a cart record. There is no partial dependency in any of the tables.

3. Third Normal Form (3NF):

3NF requires that the table is in 2NF and that no transitive dependency exists, meaning non-key attributes must not depend on other non-key attributes.

Looking through the tables:

In the user table, name, email, password, and phone_number depend only on the id (primary key), and none of these depend on another non-key attribute.

In the orders table, total_amount and order_date depend only on the id (primary key), with no transitive dependencies.

The same applies to other tables like reviews, payment, cart, etc.

Thus, all tables are in 3NF as there are no transitive dependencies.

Conclusion:
The schema is well-structured, adheres to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, and is normalized to 3NF. It avoids redundancy and ensures efficient database design.
